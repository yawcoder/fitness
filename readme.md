Hello and welcome to my fitness app.


INSPIRATION!!!
This project was inspired by my love for home workouts. I am a firm believer of staying fit with or without the gym. I built this project with the ExerciseDB API I found on rapidapi.com. The API has over 1300 exercise demonstrations including gym workouts and body weight workouts.

Since I love home workouts, I built this project by filtering out only exercises done with body weight which brings me to about 300 demonstrations.

STACK
I built this app with plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript. The only frameowrk I used was TailwindCSS which I love so much. Ever since I learnt how to use Tailwind, I have never looked back. Deployment was done with netlify.

When you visit the homepage with the link above, you can click the 'Get Started' button to view the workout page. On the workout page, you can see all demonstrations of exercises performed with body weight only. Lets say you need to train a particular part of your body, for example chest, you can view chest workouts by selecting 'chest' in the dropdown menu and click 'Train'.
